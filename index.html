                    <p> I decided to create this page because I would like to tell a bit about myself. Have you already guessed that I'm a coffee person?</p>
                    <p> Not that long ago, I moved to the United States and settled down in Seattle (coffee also mattered) from my home country Ukraine. If you have not heard about Ukraine yet, please check this out - <a class ="home-country nav-link" href="https://ukrainer.net/en/" target="_blank">Ukraine</a>. Perhaps it would be your next trip destination!</p>
                    <p> Also want to mention that I'm very passionate about web development... being a creative person, web development looks like a kind of digital art to me! </p>
                    <p> Oh, the section space runs out, so I'll be short... </p>
                    <p> Saying that, feel free to reach out or check my portfolios!</p>
